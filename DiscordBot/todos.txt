1. Prettify the embed 'Welcome' message! 
2. Add slash command to start a report 
3. add a 'no' button to confirm flow and it should restart actions 
4. change view from never timing out to timing out after 180 and then restarting flow. 
5. when user cancels after submitting report link, we need to reset user state
--> I tried this to retrigger flow: 
  if view.confirmed is True:
                fake_message = discord.Message()
                fake_message.content = "cancel" 
                fake_message.author = self.reports[author_id]
                fake_message.channel = message.channel 
                await self.reports[author_id].handle_message(fake_message)
                await message.channel.send("Report cancelled. Please try again.")
but that does not seem to work
6. fix buttons workflow -- doing explicit semantic response rn and will go back and refactor after milestone 2 deadline

7. if they type in wrong text, how do we just quit and restart? 
8. add embed back in
9. add in regexes to handle variations of same message i.e. YES vs yes vs yEs etc. 
10. do i need a counter to remember user progress in addition to state vars? 
11. handle else statements for selecting reasons
12. some of the blocking logic is in report.py PERP_INFO -- needs to be sent to bot.py 

13. SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REPORT ONESELF




Main todos: 
1. Implement user flow as diagram shows
2. Implement database --> multiple reports by the user. need outcome of report.
3. Person cannot report themselves
