1. Prettify the embed 'Welcome' message! 
2. Add slash command to start a report 
3. add a 'no' button to confirm flow and it should restart actions 
4. change view from never timing out to timing out after 180 and then restarting flow. 
5. when user cancels after submitting report link, we need to reset user state
--> I tried this to retrigger flow: 
  if view.confirmed is True:
                fake_message = discord.Message()
                fake_message.content = "cancel" 
                fake_message.author = self.reports[author_id]
                fake_message.channel = message.channel 
                await self.reports[author_id].handle_message(fake_message)
                await message.channel.send("Report cancelled. Please try again.")
but that does not seem to work
